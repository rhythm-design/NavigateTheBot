<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


![Untitled design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56234578/224162813-f8bca444-abf3-4dcc-849d-80d8f82563be.gif)

This is an intelligent virtual bot capable of finding the shortest path to a destination using MERN Stack and Data Structures and Algorithms. This project comes from Google Maps ability to navigate traffic and provide efficient routes.

Below are some details how this virtual bot is made from scratch:
* Used ReactJS library to implement a single page user interface to interact with the virtual bot.
* Used HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and visually-appealing user interface.
* Used Graph Algorithms(Dijkstra's and A-star Algorithm) for giving ability to virtual bot for finding the shortest path from source to destination efficiently despite of any traffic in between route.
